Once I felt limited by what the app&rsquo;s editor provided, I started creating scripts and web pages to create projects that were otherwise not possible. Because the Hopscotch team was open to it, I&rsquo;ve always been tinkering and seeing what else I could find or create. They have been around since 2013, but there was never a way to browse for people&rsquo;s projects on the web. So, within a day of Hopscotch documenting a few public API endpoints, I created a “proof of concept” page (using Hopscotch&rsquo;s public API endpoints) that let you do just that.</p> <p>My announcement to the community in 2019 got quite popular, and to my surprise the cofounder of Hopscotch, Samantha John, came across my post and asked if I was willing to help implement it in a full time internship! That marked the start of the internship, where I began by rewriting components of my unofficial version and officially creating their web platform.</p> <div class="showcase-item"><p class="links"> <a href="https://about.gethopscotch.com/" target="_blank">About Hopscotch</a> <a href="https://ae-hopscotch.github.io/hs-tools/explore-channel/" target="_blank">Unofficial Community Page</a> </p></div> </div> <div class="content-wrapper"> <h1>My Contributions</h1> <p>Within the team, I was the only person actively working on the web platform. In the summer of 2021, I created the “explorer” part of the Hopscotch web platform, which allows users to browse community projects, follow users, and give likes. I worked closely with the Product Manager at the time, and together we defined what features were most important, wrote down the expected behavior for every step of the flow, and made a timeline for the development of that feature.</p> <p>Once an idea was fleshed out and approved, I would develop it, submit for code review from a senior software engineer, then get acceptance from the Product Manager before pushing the change to production. The first summer, I made 101 pull requests and worked with the Community Manager to announce 2 major releases!</p> <div class="screenshot-grid"> <div class="img-container"> <img src="/images/experience/hopscotch-s1.png" alt="Sticky notes denoting which processes perform which actions in a login flow" width="425"> <p class="caption">Sticky Planning: before developing the login feature, we scoped how the environments should change.</p> </div> <div class="img-container"> <img src="/images/experience/hopscotch-s2.png" alt="Web Explorer interface with popup overlay containing small title and login status text" width="425"> <p class="caption">User Login Menu Design: Screenshot of the design for when the user taps the profile icon.</p> </div> <div class="img-container"> <img src="/images/experience/hopscotch-s3.png" alt="Popup asking the user to confirm donating a plant to the user" width="425"> <p class="caption">Planting Projects: At the end of my first internship, I implemented donating in-app currency to projects.</p> </div> <div class="img-container"> <img src="/images/experience/hopscotch-s4.png" alt="Screenshot of doc with MVP and nice to have features as well as rough layout ideas" width="425"> <p class="caption">Editor Scoping: In summer 2022, I scoped out editor features based on existing Hopscotch tools I made.</p> </div> <div class="img-container"> <img src="/images/experience/hopscotch-s5.png" alt="Screenshot of the design file for the Hopscotch web editor" width="425"> <p class="caption">Editor Design: Using the MVP feature list, I created a design resembling an old version of the iOS app.</p> </div> <div class="img-container"> <img src="/images/experience/hopscotch-s6.png" alt="Split view of mobile code editor and profile page" width="425"> <p class="caption">The Final Product: I designed the explorer and editor in a way that would work well for both desktop and mobile.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="content-wrapper"> <h1>More than an Internship</h1> <p>While my experience at Hopscotch was an internship role, my years of experience using their product allowed it to be a lot more than just a summer internship. Within the internship, <a href="https://help.gethopscotch.com/article/216-what-is-hopscotch-web#sbContact" target="_blank">I spearheaded the development of Hopscotch&rsquo;s entire web platform</a> and took on a very product-centric role. It challenged me to prioritize features that lined up with the company&rsquo;s goals and were more important to an average user, and the hands-off management structure really allowed me to take charge of my own schedule, pacing, and development of the product as a whole.</p> <p>Fast forward a few years, I was asked to return to the company to help expand their vision. As someone who had experience building for them, I took on a more senior developer role, gave constructive feedback on their code, and improved my own ability to both read code and rewrite old logic to make it more clear. Additionally, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to brainstorm experiences outside of just the editor. Lately, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to brainstorm new experiences like creating code “templates” to share with others, lay the foundations to support keyboard input on computers, and create flows to improve the user experience for managing family subscriptions.</p> <div class="center hug-wave mt-64"> <a class="button orange-cta" href="https://explore.gethopscotch.com/" target="_blank">Explore Hopscotch</a> </div> </div> </section> <footer> <img src="/images/footer-wave.svg" alt="Footer Wave" width="100%"> <div class="footer-flex"> <div class="column"> <img src="/images/e-circle-gray.png" alt="E Logo" width="48" height="48"> </div> <div class="column"> <h3>Projects</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/projects/hackeval.html">HackEval</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/hopscotch-web-editor.html">Hopscotch Web Editor</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/treasurehacks-organization-site.html">Treasure Hacks Website</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/usde-college-search.html">USDE College Search</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/">See more...</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="column"> <h3>Experience</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/experience/hopscotch.html">Lead Developer at Hopscotch</a></li> <li><a href="/experience/ics-student-council.html">Team Lead at ICS Student Council</a></li> <li><a href="/experience/treasure-hacks.html">Cofounder &amp; CTO at Treasure Hacks</a></li> <li><a href="/experience/gamechanger.html">Cofounder of GameChanger</a></li> <li><a href="/experience/" rel="canonical">See more...</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="column"> <h3>Connect</h3> <ul> <li><span>Email: <a href="mailto:ethan@awesome-e.dev">ethan@awesome-e.dev</a></span></li> <li><span>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethanw2004" target="_blank">/in/ethanw2004</a></span></li> <li><span>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Awesome-E" target="_blank">@Awesome-E</a></span></li> </ul> </div> </div> </footer> <script type="module" src="/index.f1147326.js"></script> </body></html>
