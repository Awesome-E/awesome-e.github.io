Needed lunch? Sure, check the Dining Hall website. Wanted to see when the next bus to the rec center would arrive? There&rsquo;s an app for that! During my first year, it was nice knowing that resources existed to help me get around campus.</p> <p>But as the year moved on, it became repetitive to open these pages on a daily basis and jump between them (as these were a part of my routine). I knew that the experience would be a lot better if they were all together... all in one app.</p> <div class="center"> <a href="https://ant-atlas.awesome-e.dev" target="_blank" class="button orange-cta">Try Ant Atlas</a> </div> </div> <div class="content-wrapper"> <h1>Bringing it Together</h1> <p>From there, I decided to create my own single-page app. At first, I wrote a quick backend route that would fetch the current day&rsquo;s dining hall menus It reduced the time it took for me to view the menus from 2 minutes to 20 seconds, and I called it a day.</p> <div class="center"> <img src="/images/projects/ant-atlas-s1.png" alt="Screenshots of UCI CampusDish website (left) and Ant Atlas (right)" width="640"> <p class="caption">Comparison between UCI&rsquo;s Dining Menu Page (left) vs Ant Atlas (right)</p> </div> <p>Then, I started using the campus shuttle (Anteater Express) more often. I thought it would be nice to have the data in the same place and for it to take less clicks to get the same information, so I created another page with the same layout and linked them to each other.</p> <p></p> <div class="center"> <img src="/images/projects/ant-atlas-s2.png" alt="Screenshots of UCI Shuttle Tracker (left) and Ant Atlas (right)" width="640"> <p class="caption">Comparison between UCI&rsquo;s Shuttle Tracker (left) vs Ant Atlas (right)</p> </div> <br> </div> <div class="content-wrapper"> <h1>Right Where You Need It</h1> <p>When consolidating the information I use on a daily basis, I developed Ant Atlas with two main qualities. First, it&rsquo;s quickly accessible so you can easily check it between two meetings or classes. Second, it has a super-focus on simplicity so that critical information is up front and center. <i>In fact, all non-essential information is omitted (take only what you need)!</i></p> <p></p> <div class="center"> <img src="/images/projects/ant-atlas-s3.png" alt="Add to Home Screen Prompt, Ant Atlas Study Spaces Page, and in-app booking window" width="640"> <p class="caption">One click is all it takes to preview your booking... all without switching apps.</p> </div> <br> </div> <div class="content-wrapper"> <h1 class="icons-container"> A Stepping Stone <div class="icons-row"> <img src="/images/logos/html.svg" alt="HTML Logo" width="44"> <img src="/images/logos/css.svg" alt="CSS Logo" width="44"> <img src="/images/logos/js.svg" alt="JavaScript Logo" width="44"> <img src="/images/logos/react.svg" alt="React Logo" width="44"> <img src="/images/logos/typescript.svg" alt="TypeScript Logo" width="44"> <img src="/images/logos/sass.svg" alt="Sass Logo" width="44"> <img src="/images/logos/node.svg" alt="Node.js Logo" width="44"> </div> </h1> <p>As I saw the need for more quick information at a glance, I knew this was a stepping stone for me &ndash; it was an opportunity for me to change how Ant Atlas was written, but it also led me to look for teams at UCI who wanted to make a positive impact on other students.</p> <p>Because this app started as a page to simply call an API and render its response nicely, I used vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But as I added pages for Class Enrollment Capacity and Available Study Spaces, I rewrote the app in React using TypeScript so it would be easier to maintain. Since Ant Atlas is a relatively simple app, rewriting it provided me with a sandbox to learn more about React and taught me how to write the same functionality more efficiently.</p> <p>My desire to help other students then led me to the ICS Student Council&rsquo;s Projects Committee, where I joined the PeterPortal team. The foundations I created through Ant Atlas allowed me to more effectively work on large-scale React projects and spend my time creating useful features instead of learning the tech stack. After two short quarters, I became the lead of PeterPortal, giving me the opportunity to lead its development and mentor new members as they familiarize themselves with the same skills that I had once learned.</p> <div class="center hug-wave mt-64"> <a href="https://ant-atlas.awesome-e.dev" target="_blank" class="button orange-cta">Visit Ant Atlas</a> </div> </div> </section> <footer> <img src="/images/footer-wave.svg" alt="Footer Wave" width="100%"> <div class="footer-flex"> <div class="column"> <img src="/images/e-circle-gray.png" alt="E Logo" width="48" height="48"> </div> <div class="column"> <h3>Projects</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/projects/hackeval.html">HackEval</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/hopscotch-web-editor.html">Hopscotch Web Editor</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/treasurehacks-organization-site.html">Treasure Hacks Website</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/usde-college-search.html">USDE College Search</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/">See more...</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="column"> <h3>Experience</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/experience/hopscotch.html">Lead Developer at Hopscotch</a></li> <li><a href="/experience/ics-student-council.html">Project Lead at ICS Student Council</a></li> <li><a href="/experience/treasure-hacks.html">Cofounder &amp; CTO at Treasure Hacks</a></li> <li><a href="/experience/gamechanger.html">Cofounder of GameChanger</a></li> <li><a href="/experience/" rel="canonical">See more...</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="column"> <h3>Connect</h3> <ul> <li><span>Email: <a href="mailto:ethan@awesome-e.dev">ethan@awesome-e.dev</a></span></li> <li><span>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethanw2004" target="_blank">/in/ethanw2004</a></span></li> <li><span>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Awesome-E" target="_blank">@Awesome-E</a></span></li> </ul> </div> </div> </footer> <script type="module" src="/index.f1147326.js"></script> </body></html>
