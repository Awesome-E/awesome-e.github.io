We began as a group of high school students hosting global online hackathons. Once we established ourselves as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, we needed to create a website to tell visitors more about us. As the CTO, I took on the role of consolidating information and creating the website.</p> <p>I made an announcement to the community in November of 2019, and to my surprise, the cofounder of Hopscotch (Samantha John) came across my post and contacted me to see if it I was willing to help implement it in a full time internship! Since then, I implemented the official web “explorer” (the parts of the app that lets you browse projects, follow users, and give likes) over the summer of 2021 and implemented the web editor over the summer of 2022.</p> </div> <div class="content-wrapper"> <h1>Iterating on Designs</h1> <p>One of the biggest struggles for our organization website was our lack of design experience and visuals due to being an online organization. The website started with a very rudimentary layout consisting of a placeholder header and a few text sections, followed by a footer. As we expanded our hackathons and reached out to more people, it was time to get new visuals and a redesign.</p> <p>At the time, we wanted to match the style of our hackathon website, with visuals of people doing different things that correlated with our mission, whether it was developing an app, pitching an idea, or being a part of the community. This design was far more aesthetically pleasing than the original version and was done over the summer of 2022.</p> <div class="center"> <div> <img src="/images/projects/treasurehacks-org-site-evolution.png" alt="From left to right: version 1 website, version 2 website, current website" width="750"> <p class="caption">The Treasure Hacks organization website designs over the years</p> </div> </div> <p>While the second design was significantly better, we wanted to have a more professional look and feel to our nonprofit organization&rsquo;s website; it was oriented towards companies and donors rather than students looking to join our events. We were also expanding our team at the time, so we delegated design work to someone specializing social media and graphics. This way, I could give feedback to refine the design and have a strong reference point when actually implementing it in code.</p> </div> <div class="content-wrapper"> <h1 class="icons-container"> Technical Details <div class="icons-row"> <img src="/images/logos/html.svg" alt="HTML Logo" width="44"> <img src="/images/logos/js.svg" alt="JavaScript Logo" width="44"> <img src="/images/logos/sass.svg" alt="Sass Logo" width="44"> <img src="/images/logos/node.svg" alt="NodeJS Logo" width="44"> </div> </h1> <p>Building and designing the Treasure Hacks website starts with forming and refining a design on Figma. After exchanging feedback and refining the design, I begin to implement the layouts using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. I also make the site fully functional even if JavaScript is disabled so that the site works for everyone. The build process uses Node.js; it compiles handlebars templates and SCSS, then copies over static assets and minifies the output.</p> <div class="center"> <a href="https://treasurehacks.org" class="button orange-cta" target="_blank">Visit Website</a> </div> </div> </section> <footer> <img src="/images/footer-wave.svg" alt="Footer Wave" width="100%"> <div class="footer-flex"> <div class="column"> <img src="/images/e-circle-gray.png" alt="E Logo" width="48" height="48"> </div> <div class="column"> <h3>Projects</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/projects/hackeval.html">HackEval</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/hopscotch-web-editor.html">Hopscotch Web Editor</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/treasurehacks-organization-site.html">Treasure Hacks Website</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/usde-college-search.html">USDE College Search</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/">See more...</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="column"> <h3>Experience (WIP)</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/experience/treasure-hacks.html">Cofounder &amp; CTO at Treasure Hacks</a></li> <li><a href="/experience/hopscotch.html">Web Developer at Hopscotch</a></li> <li><a href="/experience/gamechanger.html">Cofounder of GameChanger</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="column"> <h3>Connect</h3> <ul> <li><span>Email: <a href="mailto:ethan@awesome-e.dev">ethan@awesome-e.dev</a></span></li> <li><span>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethanw2004" target="_blank">/in/ethanw2004</a></span></li> <li><span>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Awesome-E" target="_blank">@Awesome-E</a></span></li> </ul> </div> </div> </footer> <script type="module" src="/index.94d5b1c8.js"></script> </body></html>
