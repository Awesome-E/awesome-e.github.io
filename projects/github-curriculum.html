I learned Git through some self learning, but most of my knowledge and practice came from an internship.</p> <p>I also noticed that a lot of hackathons claim to be beginner friendly. However, after I attended a few of them, I noticed that there was nothing done to address the lack of knowledge on topics like source code management, which are essential to organizing a codebase (especially in a short amount of time). So, when I was hosting a beginner-friendly hackathon myself, I designed a workshop and wrote a guide so people have all the resources they need to get a grasp on tools that are essential to creating a project in a group.</p> <p>I believed that learning Git should be more accessible towards beginners, so I hosted the “GitHub 101” workshop at <a href="https://hackathon.treasurehacks.org" target="_blank">my hackathon</a> and wrote guides for collaborating with Git. This would help participants learn how to store their code in the cloud in the same way as everyone in the workplace.</p> </div> <div class="content-wrapper"> <h1 class="icons-container"> The Workshop <div class="icons-row"> <img src="/images/logos/git.svg" alt="Git Logo" width="44"> <img src="/images/logos/html.svg" alt="HTML Logo" width="44"> </div> </h1> <p>The first part of the curriculum was hosting a workshop for my hackathon. This workshop used basic HTML to create a website for the purpose of demonstration, and once I had a page to show, I introduced the idea of pushing changes to GitHub using GitHub Desktop. Following that, I wanted people to be able to see that their code was stored in the cloud, so I walked through getting a personal web URL using GitHub pages, making it easier to show how code on the remote is directly correlated with pushing changes.</p> <p>I also talked about the idea of version control and its purpose: easily finding which change did what and when it was made. While commands like <code>git log</code> show changes, I used GitHub desktop because it shows the commits visually, which is helpful for those new to the concept. At the end of the workshop, I also opened the floor for Q and A so that people could get answers to any questions they had about creating an app, hosting code on GitHub, using it, and anything else related to the topic.</p> <div class="screenshot-grid"> <div class="img-container"> <div class="center img-container"> <iframe class="rounded" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ApQs6WGzoDw?si=q6SJ4LyxCFOAqF5u" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> <p class="caption">The GitHub 101 Workshop I ran at Treasure Hacks</p> </div> <a class="img-container" href="https://treasurehacks.dev/github101" target="_blank"> <img class="rounded" src="/images/projects/github-curriculum-s1.png" alt="Screenshot of GitHub Desktop showing changed files" width="300"> <p class="caption">The &ldquo;GitHub 101&rdquo; Written Guide for self-paced learning</p> </a> </div> <div class="content-wrapper"> <h1>The Collaboration Guide</h1> <p>The collaboration guide (dubbed “GitHub 201”) covers all the basics of collaborating with Git.

These are essential skills for those working in the industry or even in a small group project, making it an extremely valuable resource for those participating in hackathons.</p> <div class="center"> <a href="https://treasurehacks.dev/github201" target="_blank"> <img class="rounded" src="/images/projects/github-curriculum-s2.png" alt="Diagram showing how users can push changes and merge branches" width="640"> <p class="caption">The written guide for &ldquo;GitHub 201&rdquo;, explaining how branches and PRs work</p> </a> </div> </div> </div></section> <footer> <img src="/images/footer-wave.svg" alt="Footer Wave" width="100%"> <div class="footer-flex"> <div class="column"> <img src="/images/e-circle-gray.png" alt="E Logo" width="48" height="48"> </div> <div class="column"> <h3>Projects</h3> <ul> <li><a href="/projects/hackeval.html">HackEval</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/hopscotch-web-editor.html">Hopscotch Web Editor</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/treasurehacks-organization-site.html">Treasure Hacks Website</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/usde-college-search.html">USDE College Search</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/">See more...</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="column"> <h3>Experience (WIP)</h3> <ul> <li><a data-href="/experience/treasure-hacks.html">Cofounder &amp; CTO at Treasure Hacks</a></li> <li><a data-href="/experience/hopscotch.html">Web Developer at Hopscotch</a></li> <li><a data-href="/experience/gamechanger.html">Cofounder of GameChanger</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="column"> <h3>Connect</h3> <ul> <li><span>Email: <a href="mailto:">email@example.com</a></span></li> <li><span>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethanw2004" target="_blank">/in/ethanw2004</a></span></li> <li><span>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Awesome-E" target="_blank">@Awesome-E</a></span></li> </ul> </div> </div> </footer> <script type="module" src="/index.94d5b1c8.js"></script> <script>document.querySelectorAll(".column ol label").forEach(e=>e.addEventListener("mouseenter",()=>{e.click()}));</script> </body></html>
