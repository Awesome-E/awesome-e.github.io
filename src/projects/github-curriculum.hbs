      <h1>The Inspiration</h1>
      <p>Git is often not taught with introductory programming courses, yet it&rsquo;s everywhere in the computer science industry. I learned Git through some self
        learning, but most of my knowledge and practice came from an internship.</p>
      <p>I also noticed that a lot of hackathons claim to be beginner friendly. However, after I attended a few of them, I noticed that there was nothing done
        to address the lack of knowledge on topics like source code management, which are essential to organizing a codebase (especially in a short amount of
        time). So, when I was hosting a beginner-friendly hackathon myself, I designed a workshop and wrote a guide so people have all the resources they need
        to get a grasp on tools that are essential to creating a project in a group.</p>
      <p>I believed that learning Git should be more accessible towards beginners, so I hosted the “GitHub 101” workshop at
        <a href="https://hackathon.treasurehacks.org" target="_blank">my hackathon</a> and wrote guides for collaborating with Git.
        This would help participants learn how to store their code in the cloud in the same way as everyone in the workplace.</p>

      <p>The first part of the curriculum was hosting a workshop for my hackathon. This workshop used basic HTML to create a website for the purpose
        of demonstration, and once I had a page to show, I introduced the idea of pushing changes to GitHub using GitHub Desktop. Following that, I
        wanted people to be able to see that their code was stored in the cloud, so I walked through getting a personal web URL using GitHub pages,
        making it easier to show how code on the remote is directly correlated with pushing changes.</p>
      <p>I also talked about the idea of version control and its purpose: easily finding which change did what and when it was made. While commands like
        <code>git log</code> show changes, I used GitHub desktop because it shows the commits visually, which is helpful for those new to the concept. At
        the end of the workshop, I also opened the floor for Q and A so that people could get answers to any questions they had about creating an app, hosting
        code on GitHub, using it, and anything else related to the topic.</p>

      <h1>The Collaboration Guide</h1>
      <p>The collaboration guide (dubbed “GitHub 201”) covers all the basics of collaborating with Git. I took many of my learnings from the internship
        I had with Hopscotch to write this guide, which covers topics like branches, pull requests, and code reviews. These are essential skills for those
        working in the industry or even in a small group project, making it an extremely valuable resource for those participating in hackathons.</p>
