      <h1>The Inspiration</h1>
      <p>So I&rsquo;ve had some history of maintaining a modified project player for the <a href="https://www.gethopscotch.com">Hopscotch app</a>.
        Along this journey, I wanted to do something the platform had never seen before: online connectivity. As the developer of an app or game, one
        of the best feelings you get is being able to make something that people enjoy using, and online multiplayer is a great way of achieving just that.</p>

        <img src="/src/images/projects/multiplayer-system-p3.png" alt="Ren: &quot;I love how into this everyone is&NewLine;It's cool to think how much all this can evolve but right now we're like THE SOCCER BALLS ARE MOVING&quot;" width="395">

      <p>A few years ago, I used Firebase&rsquo;s realtime database to handle this. However, it became evident that while Firebase was easy to set up, it
        was not designed to constantly stream data like you would in a multiplayer game. I was then inspired to make my own multiplayer system which was able
        to perform the same actions but in a system that was designed to handle this.</p>

      <p>The backend of my Realtime Multiplayer System was built using Node.js, Socket.IO, and MongoDB. It handles all the logic from joining rooms to
        changing settings and reading/writing data. I achieve realtime functionality through the user of replica sets and change streams, which allow me
        to emit data through websockets to all connected clients. Using a DBMS like MongoDB also means that users can join after the multiplayer session
        has started and still receive all data associated with the room. I also wrote tests using Jest to ensure that functions like putting clients into
        the correct room worked properly.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://github.com/AE-Hopscotch/hs-tools/blob/main/play-project/scripts/multiplayer.js">frontend code</a> is part of my public Hopscotch
        Tools project, and it uses JavaScript to communicate with the backend for projects with multiplayer actions enabled. Its implementation works similar
        to other actions in my modified project player, which lets users add a custom block to their code to specify when they run.</p>

      <h1>Demo Projects</h1>
      <p>While these projects are unfinished Hopscotch games, they demonstrate the capability of the realtime multiplayer system. Feel free to reach out to me
        at <a href="mailto:ethan@awesome-e.dev">ethan@awesome-e.dev</a> for a demo!</p>
